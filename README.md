# Simple-Shell

A simple computer shell inspired by the final project in COMP 211 at UNC.

## Functionality 

As shown in the photos below, this simple slsh (sam leggett shell) executes basic commands when running in a terminal, similar to those you would use to navigate the terminal normally. 

### cd, ls

### mkdir

### touch

### cat, vim

### rm 

### cp

## Moving Forward

I intend to make the shell more personalized in the future -- I'll maybe evem include some ASCII graphics. I eventually also want to attempt making a shell that can simulate my SAP code or manipulate the SAP's .dig files and the data within them.
