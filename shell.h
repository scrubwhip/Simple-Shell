/**
 * cmd->argv[0] is a program, e.g., "ls", "rm", "vim", etc.
 * This function determines whether the program can be found
 * in one of the directories in $PATH. If so, mutates cmd->argv[0] to be the
 * full path to the program and returns true. Else, returns false. In short,
 * this behaves similarly to the `which` command.
 *
 * To see the format of $PATH, run `echo $PATH` in your terminal, which should
 * output something like
 * /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/mnt/learncli/bin
 *
 * For example, suppose prog is "ls". This function attempts to find its
 * absolute path in the file system. For the $PATH above,
 * it appends "/ls" to the first directory, resulting in
 * /usr/local/sbin/ls. However, this file does not exist, and same for the next
 * two directories. However, /usr/bin/ls exists and is a regular file, so the
 * function mutates cmd->argv[0] to be "/usr/bin/ls" and returns true.
 *
 * If the executable is "doesnotexist", then this function would not find that
 * file after checking all directories in $PATH, so it would return false.
 *
 * To access $PATH within C, use getenv. For example, getenv("PATH");
 *
 * If you need to specify a maximum length (e.g., when declaring a char[] to
 * store the $PATH string or as an argument to strncpy), use MAX_ENV_VAR_LEN.
 *
 * To parse PATH, we recommend strtok, as described in the docstring for the
 * parse function.
 *
 * To check whether a file exists and is a regular file, use stat and S_ISREG.
 * See https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html and
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/40163393/18479243.
